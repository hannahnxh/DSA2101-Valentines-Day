DSA2101 Valentine’s Day Group Project.

Our group decided on the Valentine’s Day Consumer Data from TidyTuesday. The data was arranged by Suraj Das for a Kaggle dataset, covering the years 2010 to 2022. This dataset, derived from annual surveys conducted by the National Retail Federation in the United States, spans the years 2010 to 2022 and examines consumer intentions and spending behaviors for Valentine’s Day celebrations.
